# Repository Agents Guide

This repository is organized into several top-level folders. Each folder can have its own `AGENTS.md` with specific guidance for work in that area.

## Top-Level Structure
- `app/` - Web app code - Main application code.
- `apple/` - macOS and iOS SwiftUI applications.
- `docs/` - Documentation site (Mintlify documentation).
- `infra/` - Infrastructure and deployment - Infrastructure as Code.
- `skills/` - Skills for Bap agent to use.

## Remarks
- For any work inside a folder, check that folder for its own `AGENTS.md` and follow those instructions.
