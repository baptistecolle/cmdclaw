## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (or the macOS/iOS app)

## Get started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [app.heybap.com](https://app.heybap.com) and create an account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your integrations">
    Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** and connect the services you want Bap to work with. Bap supports Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Drive, Notion, Linear, GitHub, Airtable, Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, and LinkedIn.

    Each integration uses OAuth, so you just click connect and authorize access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start a conversation">
    Open a new chat and ask Bap to do something with your connected services. For example:

    - *"What's on my calendar today?"*
    - *"Send an email to Alex about the project update"*
    - *"Create a Linear issue for the login bug"*
    - *"Find the latest messages in #general on Slack"*
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Approvals

When Bap wants to perform a sensitive action (sending an email, creating an issue, etc.), it asks for your approval first. You can review exactly what it will do before confirming.

If you trust Bap for a particular conversation, you can toggle **auto-approve** to skip the approval step.

## Voice input

On macOS and iOS, you can use voice input to talk to Bap. Your speech is transcribed using Whisper and sent as a message.
