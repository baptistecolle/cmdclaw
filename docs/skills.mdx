Skills are reusable instructions that teach CmdClaw how to perform specific tasks. Instead of repeating the same context every conversation, you create a skill once and CmdClaw can use it whenever relevant.

## Creating a skill

Go to **Settings > Skills** in the app and click **Create Skill**. You need to provide:

- **Name** -- A display name for the skill (e.g., "Weekly Report")
- **Description** -- A short description of what the skill does

CmdClaw automatically generates a `SKILL.md` file with your skill's instructions. This is the core of your skill -- it tells CmdClaw exactly what to do.

## The SKILL.md file

Every skill has a `SKILL.md` file that contains frontmatter and instructions in Markdown:

```markdown
---
name: weekly-report
description: Generate a weekly status report from Linear and Slack
---

# Weekly Report

1. Pull my completed Linear issues from the past 7 days
2. Summarize key Slack messages from #engineering
3. Format as a status report with sections: Completed, In Progress, Blockers
```

You edit this file directly in the built-in editor, which supports headings, lists, code blocks, and other Markdown formatting.

## Adding files

You can add extra files to a skill beyond `SKILL.md`. This is useful for templates, examples, or reference material that CmdClaw should follow when executing the skill.

## Uploading documents

Skills support document uploads (PDFs, images, etc.) that CmdClaw can reference. This is useful for providing brand guidelines, templates, or any reference material.

## Enabling and disabling

Each skill has an enabled/disabled toggle. Disabled skills are not available to CmdClaw during conversations. This lets you keep skills around without them cluttering your active set.
