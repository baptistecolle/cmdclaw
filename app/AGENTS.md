use bun and not npm

use bun db:push for migration and not db:generate

when editing plugin of better-auth, use bun auth:generate to generate the schema again

only commit when i ask you to do so

you can do bun run typecheck     to check type

after implementing a feature, ideally test it through bun run chat
if bun run chat is not good enough to test the feature, report that clearly so the user knows
