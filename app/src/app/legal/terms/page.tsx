        number, contact person&apos;s name, email address, phone number, etc.). Confirm their
        acceptance of the General Terms. Confirm their registration. Access to the Services is
        possible by connecting to the Site from a computer, smartphone, or tablet. The use of the

        connection. Clients are responsible for providing the necessary computer and
        telecommunication equipment to access the Site. The Services can only be accessed from one
        connection at a time. When creating an account with an email address, the Client is prompted
        to choose a password, which ensures the confidentiality of the information contained in
        their account. To validate the registration, the Service Provider sends a confirmation email
        to the email address provided by the Client. The Client then activates their account by
        clicking on the hyperlink provided for this purpose in the confirmation email. Each Client
        guarantees the truthfulness and accuracy of the information provided for their registration,
        agrees to notify any subsequent changes, and guarantees that such information does not
        infringe upon the rights of third parties. The Client can modify this information, as well
        as their login credentials and password, from their account on the Site. The Client
        undertakes not to disclose or transfer their account, login credentials, and password, and
        is solely responsible for their use until they are deactivated. The Client must immediately
        inform the Service Provider of any loss or unauthorized use of their account. The Service
        Provider reserves the right to delete the account of any Client who has provided inaccurate
        information.

        for the Services included in the order, the Service Provider will send a confirmation email
        to the Client at the email address provided by the Client. The confirmation email will
        summarize the essential characteristics of the ordered Service(s), the total price, and any
        other relevant information. It will also include a tracking number for the Client&apos;s
        order. By placing an order on the Site, the Client expressly agrees to receive an electronic

        to provide the requested information and/or documentation, the Service Provider reserves the
        right to refuse or cancel the order without any possibility of dispute. The Service Provider
        also reserves the right to refuse or cancel the order of any Client who has provided

        if applicable. The Service Provider publishes the Services available on the Site and hosts

        provider and does not exercise any control over the legality, accuracy, quality, or
        sincerity of the content uploaded by the Clients under their responsibility. Consequently,
        the Clients acknowledge that the Service Provider qualifies as a hosting provider for the
        Site within the meaning of Article 6 of Law No. 2004-575 of June 21, 2004, on confidence in
        the digital economy. However, the Service Provider undertakes to promptly remove any
        manifestly illegal content that is brought to its attention, particularly when the existence
        of such content has been notified to it by a Client in accordance with applicable
        regulations. Furthermore, the Service Provider strives to ensure access to and proper
        functioning of the Site twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. However, the Service
        Provider cannot exclude the possibility that access to and functioning of the Site may be
        interrupted, particularly in cases of force majeure, malfunction of the Clients&apos;
        equipment or internet network, telecommunication operator failure, power supply
        interruption, abnormal, unlawful, or fraudulent use of the Site by a Client or a third
        party, decisions by competent authorities, or for any other reason. The Service Provider
        also reserves the right to make any modifications and improvements of its choice to the Site
        and the Services, related to technical advancements or proper functioning. General and
        temporary interruptions of the Site and the Services will, whenever possible, be notified
        via the Site before they occur, unless such interruptions are of an urgent nature.

        applicable to their professional status. Not modify, alter, during the provision of the
        Services, their nature or terms of provision, except with the prior written agreement of the

        the Services or any abnormal, abusive, or fraudulent use of the Site of which they become

        legislation or infringement of the rights of third parties, the Service Provider reserves
        the right to provide, at the request of any legitimate authority (court, administrative
        authority, police services), any information that allows or facilitates the identification
